# Contributing to SYCL-rs

## Development setup

Install a Rust toolchain with Rust 2024 edition support and Intel oneAPI Toolkit
2026.1. Clone the repository and initialize the oneAPI environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneapi-rs.git
cd oneapi-rs
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
cargo build --workspace
```

Replace `/opt/intel/oneapi` if the toolkit is installed elsewhere. To select a
specific SYCL compiler, set `ONEAPI_CXX` to its full path.

## Formatting

Check Rust formatting:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

Check tracked C and C++ sources with `clang-format`:

```bash
git ls-files -z -- ':(glob)**/*.cpp' ':(glob)**/*.hpp' ':(glob)**/*.h' \
    | xargs -0 --no-run-if-empty clang-format --dry-run --Werror
```

To apply Rust formatting, run `cargo fmt --all`. Apply C++ formatting with the
project's installed `clang-format` before rerunning the check above.

## Tests and examples

Initialize the oneAPI environment in the current shell, then run the workspace
tests:

```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
cargo test --workspace --verbose
```

The tests and examples require a working SYCL runtime and visible compatible
device.
